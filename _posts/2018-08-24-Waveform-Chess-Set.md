A 3D printed chess set - with pieces generated from audio waveforms.

Audacity was used to record my voice stating the name of the game piece (ex. "Rook", "Knight", etc.).

The Waveform was then screenshot, inserted into Solidworks, and one half of the wave was traced with the spline function.

The profile was closed and rotated about the waveform centerline to generate a 3D representation of the wave. A base was added and the piece was scaled appropriately.
This process was repeated for each piece.

The chessboard was then lasercut from veneer plywood.
