## History and Context:

Parents and pet owners should always be aware of the danger of leaving an unattended kid or pet in a car. Even if it's not summer, temperatures in cars can rapidly climb, making it unsafe for children and pets. A test done by Consumer Reports showed that an outside temperature of 61° F could reach more than 105° F in a closed car in just an hour, exceeding the internal body temperature threshold for heat stroke in children. North Carolina Consumers Council reveals that the internal car temperature can rise more than 20° F in 10 minutes, even if it's cloudy. Unsafe temperatures in cars claim the lives of around 37 children annually, a number much too high. In more than half the situations, the child was forgotten. Other times, the adult was aware of where the child was. A child’s body heats up three to five times faster than an adult’s body. Dogs are more likely than children to be left in cars and can be more sensitive to heat as well. It is imperative that you take measures to ensure the safety of children and pets in cars.

Devices that monitor internal car temperature and notify the car owner are available, but it seems that more of them are made for dogs/pets. Some devices send text message alerts while others are attachable to a pet collar.
