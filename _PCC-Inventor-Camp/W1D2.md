## Intro to Soldering

Soldering is a method of joining electrical components together, like those you make on your bread board, but in a more permanent fashion. 

### Soldiering Guides

- [Sparkfun Guide to Soldiering](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering)
- [Adafruit guite to Excelent Soldiering](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-guide-excellent-soldering/tools)
- [How to Soldier- Video](https://youtu.be/QKbJxytERvg)


** Disclaimer ** Traditional soldering uses a tin/lead solder, which melts easily and makes strong connections, but is toxic to humans over repeated exposure. A less toxic, lead-free solder is now used in all consumer electronics in the US, however it is more difficult to use and requires a higher temperature soldering iron. In this class, we will primarily use leaded soldering iron as it is the one that is easiest to learn with. If safety procedures are followed, risk of exposure is negligable, F0r students who wish, unleaded solder will be provided. 

#### Soldering Safety:
- Wear Safety Glasses (to protect from solder splatter, wire clippings)
- Create a clear workspace (Make sure soldering Iron will not come into contact with nearby objects, make sure it has a holder for when not in use)
- Do not touch soldiering end (A soldiering iron can remain hot after being turned off)
- Wear Gloves during soldiering or wash hands immediately after soldiering (gloves strongly recommended, as absent-minded hand-to-mouth contact can bring you into contact with lead traces).
