## The Problem:

For those who have easy access to clean water, it is hard to understand the effects of using too much water daily. A lot of people use well over the required amount and this is bad for the environment because, it removes water from the ecosystems.

## The Solution:
An invention to address this problem would be:
A device that brings awareness to domestic water waste by tracking water usage called "Water We Wasting"


## Invention Attributes:

**Minimum Requirements**:

- Track gallons from single faucet
- Reports to user


**Secondary Goals**:

- Report How much water should be using
- Whether or not they wasted or saved
- Display on screen
- Adjust to any faucet
- LED lights
- Sound
- Celebrate saving water
- Sad sound when over
- Alert close to water usage cap

**Reach Goals**:

- Number of people setting
- Pet setting
- Place setting
Stops water
- Dirty water clean water rotation device to regulate water usage
- Adjust the amount of water coming out of the faucet
- Tracks over weeks to see data (saving water? Is device helping?)



## History and Context:

- Bare minimum of water needed: 1 gallon per person per day

- Effect of uses too much water: Colorado river feeds 30 million since 1920 and has shrunk 130 feet causing droughts and killing ecosystems.

- Demand for water has gone up 55% causing 1,900 wells to run dry

- Effect of too much CO2: Glaciers melt causing ocean to go up 216 feet

- Required water for different types of pets:
  - (About a gallon)
[https://www.cesarsway.com/dog-care/hydration/hydrate-your-hound-for-health]()
  - About half a gallon

- Average amount of water used by American: 88 gallons per day
[http://www.2oceansvibe.com/2018/02/07/have-a-guess-how-much-water-the-average-american-uses-every-day/]()

- Minnesota uses 0-75 gallons per person per day

- Thereâ€™s a big difference between saltwater and freshwater. This means, freshwater is limited. 97.5% is saltwater and 2.5% is freshwater. 

- Ice caps/glaciers 2.38% Ground water 0.397% Surface water (e.g., lakes, rivers, streams, ponds) 0.022% Atmosphere 0.001%   
[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-08/documents/mgwc-ww-intro.pdf]()

- A study calculates that by 2050, groundwater pumping will cause a global sea level rise of about 0.8 millimeters per year.

Wasting water increases the demand for clean water. Eventually, it will lead to the usage of underground water. In order to extract the underground water, the burning of fossil fuels is involved. Fossil fuel increases the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere which can cause the Earth temperature to rise causing glaciers in the North pole and Antarctica to melt. While glaciers hold fresh water the water would not be accessible if melted. The water melted from the glaciers would deposit directly into the ocean. Due to the size of glaciers, if they melted the ocean would rise 216 feet causing many cities to go be buried by the sea. 

- Wasting water ? More demand for clean water ? usage of underground water ? digging wells ? Fossil fuel to extract water ? Increases amount of CO2 ? Earth Temperature Rises
