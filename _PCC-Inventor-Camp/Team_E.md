## The Problem:
For people that don't have any type of outdoor growing area or a climate that does not support the growth of the plants, it is hard to grow anything when you don't have the proper tools or the right environment because the plants might need a specific type of environment to grow properly.

## The Solution:

An Invention to address this problem would:

Monitor PH levels/moisture
Self automated watering 
Liquid fertilizer 
Recycled materials 
Its sustainable 


## Invention Attributes:


**Minimum Requirements**:

IT WOULD INCLUDE:
10-15 sections for planting
Automated watering system
Affordable

**Secondary Goals**:

Hopefully a vertical/mobile design 

**Reach Goals**:

If we have time a PH level monitor

## History and Context:

People that don't have a garden outside
People whoâ€™s soil isn't good for planting
Someone that doesn't have a good climate for growing outside

PLANTS-thyme, basil, mint, oregano, cilantro, lemon balm, kale, lettuce, scallions, arugula, spinach, sage

Hydroponics plants and how they work!
Hydroponics is a branch of agriculture where plants are grown without the use of soil. The nutrients that the plants normally derive from the soil are simply dissolved into water instead, and depending on the type of hydroponic system used, the plant's roots are suspended in, flooded with or misted with the nutrient solution so that the plant can derive the elements it needs for growth.

Regular soil plants:
Nutrients in the soil also help plants grow strong. Some nutrients that plants need are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. ... This limits their access to soil nutrients and weakens the plant's hold in the ground.
                                     
SOCIAL CONTEXT: 
Food insecurity
Cheaper
