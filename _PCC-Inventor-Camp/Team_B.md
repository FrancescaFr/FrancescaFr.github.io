## The Problem:

For blind and low vision persons it is hard to cook complex and/or healthy meals because so much of the process is vision dependent and blind/low vision issues are often overlooked.

## The Solution:

An Invention to address this problem would be:
A modular, low-vision or blind kitchen aid system called, “Kitchen A.I.D.”

## Invention Attributes:

**Minimum Requirements**:

Read recipes to the user at a controllable pace
Connect them to synced devices including-- 
A measuring device
Thermometer
Audible Labels

**Secondary Goals**:

Easy to understand user interface
Text to speech integrated into the system (instead of pre recorded recipes)
Scale synced to the rest of the system

**Reach Goals**:

we would like to have devices that listen to the user/speech to text.
