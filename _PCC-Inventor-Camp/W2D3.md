- Final Project: Finalizing Design Solutions, Mockups, Intro Presentations
- Printer Take-Apart

-------------------


## Final Project:

Students should have finished identifying their solution goals and will continue to solidify their invention designs through sketching, sub-system identification, and design Mockups.

Students will then give a preliminary summary of their problem and invention goals, sharing their mockups and design drawings and opening the floor to questions.


## Printer Take-Apart:

Today we will be taking apart broken inkjet printers. The objective of this activity is to demystify the funcitonality of household objects, reveal the fundamental components that go into moving systems, and salvage usable components for potential project use (Stepper Motors, Limit switches, etc).
