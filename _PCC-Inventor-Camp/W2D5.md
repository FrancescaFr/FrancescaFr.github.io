## Project Work:

### Sub-Systems

A key step in solving broad engineering problems, like building an invention from scratch, is to identify the sub-systems, or sub-problems, within your larger goal.

Today is about asking ourselves, what are the little things I need to get working, so that my final invention will function?

__ Your Deliverable for today is a _Sub-system Map:__ Identify the subsystems in your project, identify the primary problems or challenges with that subsystem, and who is responsable for making sure that problem is addressed? 

<br>

Ususally your project will contain the following components, which can be thought of as broad sub-systems:

- _Structural/Mechanical:_ The physical form of your project, along with mechanisms that allow for physical movement (Wheels, levers, enclosures).
- _Electrical:_ The wiring and electronic components of your project (Power supply, connectors, sensors, actuators- _which interface with mechanical sub-systems_).
- _Programming:_ The software logic of your project, that ensures that your invention processes information and responds appropriately.

<br>
All of these sub-systems have their own associated sub-problems, and they all need to integrate together in the final project form.

<br> Most engineering groups break up these sub-systems amongst the team members, so that there is always at least one person responsible for ensuring that sub-system is on track. However, it is also critical to communicate between the sub-system specialists, so that everything fits together in the end. 



### Ex: Building a Smart Trashcan

_Invention_ : Build a Trashcan that opens automatically and drives to the curb on Trashday, when it is at least 1/2 full.


####  Team and Problem Structure:

- Mechanical Lead: Laurie
 (Sub-Systems)
  - Wheel Base + Motor
  - Trash Can
  - Lid + Motor

- Electrical Lead: Taylor
(Sub-Systems)
  - Battery + Charging Mechanism
  - Wiring 
  - Motion Sensor
  - Weight Sensor
  - Alarm System
 
- Programming Lead: Erin
(Sub-Systems)
  - Time-Tracking
  - Weight Sensing
  - Navigation
  
The Mechanical Lead can build most of the physical mechanism independent of the other two team members, but Laurie needs to know how much space to leave for all the electrical components, and to know where to mount the motion sensor, scale, etc.

The Electrical Lead needs to coordinate with both the programmer and the mechanical lead to know where to run wires to and make sure that all the sensors are compatible with the intended run program.

The Programmer needs to know details about the physical structure, and the sensors, in order to write any functional code.
