PCC's Inventor Camp was a 3-week intensive camp based on [PSU's 4-week Invention Bootcamp](https://www.pdx.edu/cecs/invention-bootcamp), created in 2016 by [Dr. Nathalie Neve](mailto:neve.nathalie@gmail.com) and currently run by Dr. Gerald Recktenwald in PSU's Engineering Department. 

Inventor Camp was made possible by funding through a grant from a donor advised fund at the Oregon Community Foundation to meet a challenge by the [Lemelson Foundation](https://www.lemelson.org/), focused on improving lives through invention.
