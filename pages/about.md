PCC's Inventor Camp is based on [PSU's Invention Bootcamp](https://www.pdx.edu/cecs/invention-bootcamp), created in 2016 by [Dr. Nathalie Neve](mailto:neve.nathalie@gmail.com) who is now [sailing in the Pacific Ocean](https://sailubi.com/) with her family.
Inventor Camp is made possible by funding from the [Lemelson Foundation](https://www.lemelson.org/), focused on improving lives through invention.
